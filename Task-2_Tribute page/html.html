        <p class="text">Vivekananda, original name Narendranath Datta, Datta also spelled Dutt, (born January 12, 1863,
            Calcutta [now
            Kolkata]—died July 4, 1902, near Calcutta), Hindu spiritual leader and reformer in India who attempted to
            combine Indian spirituality with Western material progress, maintaining that the two supplemented and
            complemented one another. His Absolute was a person’s own higher self; to labour for the benefit of humanity
            was the noblest endeavour.

            Born into an upper-middle-class family of the Kayastha (scribes) caste in Bengal, he was educated at a
            Western-style university where he was exposed to Western philosophy, Christianity, and science. Social
            reform became a prominent element of Vivekananda’s thought, and he joined the Brahmo Samaj (Society of
            Brahma), dedicated to eliminating child marriage and illiteracy and determined to spread education among
            women and the lower castes. He later became the most-notable disciple of Ramakrishna, who demonstrated the
            essential unity of all religions.</p>

        <p class="text">Vivekananda is credited with contributing to a revival of modern Hinduism and inspiring nationalist
            consciousness during colonial rule. But he is best known for his famous 1893 speech where he introduced
            Hinduism to the Western world in Chicago.</p>
